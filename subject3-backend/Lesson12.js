Build an App using an API

Lesson 10 - Plans

1. Explain frontend and backend using IPAD
2. NPM, Express, Middleware and 
3. RESTful API -> Representated State Transfer Protocol

### Part 1: Node, NPM and setting up the environment

1. why do we need to use Node JS? 
    1. Node JS browser run time environment that allows to execute JavaScript code beyond web browser? LTS support 
    2. Explain how Node JS allows to run javascript code outside of browser. There are lots of Native 

What is NPM?
NPM - node package manager → these allows to manage all the javascript file in our project. Place which collects modules built have for node → utility and tools to help writing node application. 
npm init → configure the project (initialise npm) → (generate the configuration) file
How to install npm install packages ()

### Part 3: Express and Middleware
1. Express → Node.js framework that allows use build web and mobile application
    1. express is the JavaScript framework built on Node for building web and mobile application (it is simple and easy without having building our own). VS code is built using Node JS
    4. express middleware 
        1. middleware that sits between client and route handler in the request-response cycle. It is used for authentication (for instance when putting your detail to sign, it is passed to through middleware to see whether you have authorisation to access or not)
        2. express json() → 
        3. express parser → it handles the body of the request (html form). Every request has the body 
        4. urlencoded → we are using with html form, urlencoded and extended set to

There are different ways of using MongoDB:

    1. Installing the MongoDB that allows us to run mongodb locally unto your system → but that installation requires different methods for different methods
    2. We are going to using MongoDB atlas → It is a cloud database which means we don’t have to install and anyone can use it as long as they create an account
    3. MongoDB and intergrading with Node JS (Installing MongoDB and mongodb compass).
    1. There are different ways of using mongodb → one is through creating the atlas cloud, on on locally using either compass or the shell. I do recommend get hands  using shell or cmd, but for now we will stick to compass
    2. Database → Collections (table) → Document (key-value pairs or row)
    3. Schema → structure of the collection document (row)
    4. Model → takes the schema and applies to the each document in the collection
    5. keys are always in strings
    6. document methods → 
    
    Database → Collections (table) → document (rows or key-value pair)
    
    Softwares to install
    
    1. MongoDB→
    2. clusters → group of servers that work together
    3. MongoDB campass → It is a graphical interface of the MongoDB database (It allows to perform CRUD in our mongodb database)
    3. Mongoose → It is a Node JS library that allows to define the data model and provide interface to the interact with the mongodb collections 

    MongoDB atlas and mongo compass:

    1. check the security if it is not working?

    Mongoose → How can we connect our project to the database (this is where mongoose comes into play)


    Recap:
    - create mongoDB account
    - create new project in mongodb atlas
    - create a cluster0
    - connect the cluster to the mongodb compass
    - install mongoose and connect our project to the mongoose
    1. create model → 
        1. Database → Collections (table) → Document (key-value pairs or row)
        2. Schema → structure of the collection document (row)
        3. Model → takes the schema and applies to the each document in the collection

    1. Restful API → What is it?
        1. RESTful → Representational state transfer
        2. REST is a software architecture that imposes some condition as to how the API should.
        3. 
    2. Postman → What is it and why do we need it?
        1. Allows you create the backend
